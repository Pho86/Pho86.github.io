# Philip Ho Portfolio
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Hosted on github pages, [https://pho86.github.io/](https://pho86.github.io/). The site is exported statically in order to be hosted on github pages.

## Licensing 
This project is licensed with the Mozilla Public License (MPL), because I am open to my code being open-sourced and public use, however I would like the code to be somewhat modified before being published to a production state instead of being a direct copy and paste of my code. The code should be accessible and reusable. Furthermore, MPL provides patent protection, to safely protect users and contributors of this repository.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
